Gives you a framework to send Gravity Forms data to SugraCRM

== Description ==

Provides a code framework so you can send Gravity Forms
data to your SugarCRM. There is NO admin interface at this
time and no real plans to make one. You will NEED to be able
to edit the code of the plugin to get this working
for yourself. You can see a tutorial on how to use it at the link
below.

This also requires that you have a copy of Gravity Forms. The plugin is
useless without it.

== Installation ==

1. Extract gf-sugarcrm/ to your wp-content/plugins/
folder.

2. Activate the plugin.
